# ROCK-PAPER-SCISSOR
## SO here is this rock paper scissor game here you need to give me your dfa its basically what set of states you'll move corresponding to each state .
## Fun fact is i don't know about your initial state but here i have written a code that outputs a winning dfa with probability of 99.98 against your dfa !!
Wanna know how , see the code :P.
